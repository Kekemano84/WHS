## Welcome email

When a new user registers, WHS sends a professional multilingual welcome email automatically if SMTP is configured.

Required environment variables on Render:

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
APP_URL=https://your-whs-app.onrender.com
```

If SMTP is not configured, registration still works and the email is skipped safely.

## v12 - Email Excel exports

Where WHS shows an Excel export, users can also click **Email Excel** to send the same report to their own registered email address.

Supported exports include Yard Check, Handover, Team, Calendar, Holiday Tracker, Mileage, Expenses, Daily Shift Log, Actions and Absence.

Render environment variables for email:

```text
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your@email.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
SMTP_FROM=your@email.com
```

Alternative names also work:

```text
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_EMAIL=your@email.com
SMTP_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

If SMTP is not configured, the app will not crash. It will show: Email sending is not configured yet.


## Email setup for welcome emails and Email Excel

WHS can send automatic welcome emails after registration and send Excel exports to the registered user's own email address.

Add these Environment Variables in Render:

```env
APP_URL=https://your-render-url.onrender.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
SMTP_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_google_app_password
SMTP_FROM=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
```

For Gmail, use a Google App Password. Your normal Gmail password will not work.

The app also supports `MAIL_SERVER`, `MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, and `MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER` if you prefer those names.
